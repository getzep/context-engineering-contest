Historical facts show camelCase was required earlier and there was a brief/temporary switch to snake_case, but those are not currently active.\n\nOther relevant fact\n- The project implicitly carries Python code-style conventions (file naming, function naming, indentation, string quotes), which may influence some cross-language conventions.\n\nIf you want, I can summarize these as a checklist you can use when editing TypeScript files, or point out where to check (example: repo lint/config files) to resolve the quote-name conflicts.",

Change DELETE handler (REST) to perform a soft-delete\n   - Have the delete endpoint mark the item as deleted (rather than hard-remove).\n   - Keep REST endpoints for CRUD operations as the canonical APIs.\n\n2. Ensure queries/filtering exclude deleted items\n   - Update read/query logic (e.g., get_user_tasks \u2014 note this function uses snake_case) to filter out soft-deleted tasks by default.\n   - Make sure the task service implements this logic (Marcus Chen is responsible for fixing the bug, likely in the task service).\n\n3. Keep cursor-based pagination correct\n   - The TaskList (task list endpoint) requires cursor-based pagination \u2014 ensure the pagination logic accounts for filtering out deleted items so cursors remain stable.\n\n4. Tests and CI\n   - Update/add integration tests to cover soft-delete behavior (there is already an integration test to check endpoint behavior).\n   - Use factory_boy for test data if preferred (Marcus Chen wants factory_boy instead of fixtures).\n   - Make sure the PR passes CI before merge (PR must pass CI).\n\n5. Client/UI considerations\n   - If the UI needs to reflect soft-deletes (restore/trash views), update the TaskList component state as needed \u2014 remember TaskList should continue using Zustand for client-side UI state.\n   - Prefer functional components with hooks for any UI changes (assistant prefers hooks).\n\n6. Observability and error handling\n   - If the change touches the task sharing endpoint or other monitored paths, ensure Sentry error tracking requirements are met where applicable (Marcus required Sentry for the task sharing endpoint).\n\nNotes\n- Keep changes consistent with existing naming conventions (snake_case for back-end functions like get_user_tasks).\n- Update or add integration tests and ensure the PR passes CI before merging.\n\nIf you want, I can produce a more detailed code-level checklist (DB/ORM changes, example query changes, test cases) \u2014 tell me what stack/ORM you\u2019re using and I\u2019ll draft specifics.",
