Keep the response format consistent with other endpoints.\n\nClient-side handling\n- Use React Query (TanStack Query); its useInfiniteQuery is compatible with and well-suited for cursor-based pagination.\n\nTesting\n- Prefer integration tests (Marcus Chen\u2019s preference) to verify endpoint pagination behavior.\n\nImplementation details and environment notes\n- External API calls in the project use httpx with async/await (the codebase has been updated accordingly).  \n- Sensitive keys have been moved to .env.local (avoid hardcoding API keys).\n\nSummary of actions\n1. Implement the task list endpoint with limit and cursor query params (cursor-based).  \n2. Return results in the standard response wrapper (data field).  \n3. On the client, implement fetching with useInfiniteQuery and pass the cursor between pages.  \n4. Write integration tests to validate pagination behavior.  \n5.
