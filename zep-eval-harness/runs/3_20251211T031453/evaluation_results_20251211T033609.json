        "answer_reasoning": "The AI response is missing several items from the golden answer. It includes VS Code with Vim keybindings and .env.local, but it does not mention iTerm2, zsh, or oh-my-zsh; it omits the Python tool 'uv'; it does not list pnpm for Node; and it does not mention pre-commit hooks for linting/formatting. Therefore it does not contain all essential information.",
