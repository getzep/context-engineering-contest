Marcus Chen instructed the task list endpoint to use cursor-based pagination.\n- Endpoint params: the API accepts a cursor parameter and a limit parameter for pagination.\n- Response shape: responses follow the standard structure where a meta object contains pagination information and other metadata \u2014 read the meta object to get the next cursor/metadata.\n- URL/versioning: API resources are under /api/v1/ and use plural resource names (e.g., /api/v1/tasks).\n- Client tooling: React Query\u2019s useInfiniteQuery is appropriate \u2014 it handles the cursor-based pagination structure effectively.\n- Testing: integration tests are preferred for the API endpoint.\n\nSimple flow to implement\n1.

Read the meta object in the response to obtain pagination info (the cursor for the next page and any other metadata).\n3. For the next page request, include the cursor parameter returned in meta plus limit.\n4. Repeat until the meta indicates there are no more pages.\n5.
