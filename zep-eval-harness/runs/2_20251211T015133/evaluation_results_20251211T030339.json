(This migration has already been created in the project context.)\n  - Run the Alembic migrations to apply the schema changes. (Migrations were run to set up the schema in the current context.)\n\n- Application / repository changes\n  - Replace hard-delete logic with code that writes the current timestamp into deleted_at for the target row(s) rather than deleting the row.\n  - Update repository queries to exclude soft-deleted rows (e.g., add WHERE deleted_at IS NULL). In the current project the assistant already updated task_repository.py to select only needed columns \u2014 you should also ensure the deleted_at filter is applied where appropriate.\n\n- Endpoint / API behavior\n  - Keep REST CRUD endpoints, but implement the \u201cdelete\u201d operation as setting deleted_at (soft delete). In current integration testing the endpoint is exercised via a PATCH request, so you can implement the soft-delete action using that endpoint shape if that matches your API.\n  - Ensure clients calling read/list endpoints receive only non-deleted rows unless you intentionally provide endpoints that include deleted items.\n\n- Performance / indexing\n  - Ensure relevant indexes exist to keep queries fast (an Alembic migration was created to add an index on user_id in the current project).\n\n- Tests and CI\n  - Update/add integration tests to hit the actual endpoint (current tests hit the endpoint via PATCH) and assert soft-delete behavior. Run CI and only merge after it passes.\n\nNotes from the context\n- The project explicitly requires soft deletes using deleted_at (not hard deletes).\n- Alembic migrations to add deleted_at (and an index on user_id) were created and applied.\n- REST endpoints are kept for CRUD and integration tests exercise the endpoint via PATCH.\n- Ensure any query changes continue to select only the needed columns (as was done in task_repository.py).\n\nIf you want, I can produce an example Alembic migration snippet or example repository query changes that apply the deleted_at filter (specify whether you want SQL or SQLAlchemy code).",
