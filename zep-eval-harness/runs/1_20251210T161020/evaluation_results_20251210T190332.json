The endpoint should be POST /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/shares\n(2025-12-11T00:10:18.458813Z) Perfect.

The React 18 concurrent features help with the GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates.\n(2025-12-11T00:10:19.024162Z) Updated the external API calls to use httpx with async/await. Matches our SQLAlchemy 2.0 async pattern in the repositories. All database operations are already non-blocking.\n(2025-12-11T00:10:18.269876Z) Added the share endpoint to src/api/v1/routers/tasks.py.
